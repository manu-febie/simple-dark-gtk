Simple Dark
---

A gtk theme generated with Oomox. It should blend pretty nice if you have the simple dark theme going on in you window manager. Cloning this repository in your `.themes` folder should be enough to let you use this theme with a program like `lxappearance`.

```
git clone https://github.com/manu-febie/simple-dark-gtk
```
